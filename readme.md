# Audible to iTunes Orchestrator

## Problem

iPod Classic, even the 7th gen, struggles playing single file audiobooks longer than 12-13 hours without a compromise in bitrate. I don't like creating a file for each chapter, which clutters my library. So I had to have my audiobooks split into fewest parts possible.

## Existing Solutions That Didn't Work Out (Like a literature review 😂)

- [Libation](https://github.com/rmcrackan/Libation) is the best solution I've found, but it can either create one file per chapter, or one file per book. You cannot specify the length you want per file.
- [AaxAudioConverter](https://github.com/audiamus/AaxAudioConverter) can embed chapter names into split books, but you have to give it a metadata file with chapter name and timings.
- [BookLibConnect](https://github.com/audiamus/BookLibConnect) can download metadata for a single file book, but fails on multi-part downloads because Audible is deprecating it.
- Custom split with ffmpeg only works if you have to bring a custom made metadata file with chapter offsets for your split files.

## My Solution

I wrote this script to:

- Make Libation download the books via its CLI,
- Split them into <10 hours long files
  - with chapter names preserved and correctly embedded on separated files,
  - without splitting mid-chapter.
